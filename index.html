    <p id="front-page-motto" class="motto">We offer affordable, efficient, quality arbitration between attorneys and clients.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>$79/party for claims under $1,500</li>
    <li>$99/party for claims between $1,501–$2,500</li>
    <li>$129/party for claims between $2,501–$5,000</li>
    <li>$159/party for claims between $5,001–$10,000</li>
    <li>$219/party for claims between $10,001–$25,000</li>
  </ul>


<p>Each side only pays after both sides agree to use FairClaims, which means there is no downside to making a claim. In fact, if you pay after both sides agree to arbitrate and the other side doesn’t pay for the process in time, we will give you a refund if the arbitration doesn’t move forward.</p>

<p>If both sides agree, one side can pay the fee for both parties. This sometimes happens between employers and employees, for example.</p>

<p>At your arbitrator’s discretion, the winning party collects their arbitration fee from the losing party—more on that if/when you move forward with an arbitration.</p>
