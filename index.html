<p>Each side only pays after both sides agree to use Professional Arbitration & Mediation, LLC, which means there is no downside to making a claim. In fact, if you pay after both sides agree to arbitrate and the other side doesn’t pay for the process in time, we will give you a refund if the arbitration doesn’t move forward.</p>

<p>If both sides agree, one side can pay the fee for both parties. This sometimes happens between employers and employees, for example.</p>

<p>At your arbitrator’s discretion, the winning party collects their arbitration fee from the losing party—more on that if/when you move forward with an arbitration.</p>
